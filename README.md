Only issue is that "requests" module is not installing from Dockerfile. I had to manually install requests in my virtual environment to avoid getting an import error.

1. Navigate to api_folder

2. Activate a virtual environment

3. Install requests 

4. Type "export FLASK_APP = apiFile"

5. run CLI commands

Commands

flask --help

flask hashcom [string]

flask factcom [int]

flask fibcom [int]

flask primecom [int]
